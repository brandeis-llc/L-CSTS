### Reannotated C-STS Dev Split
We include our reannotated C-STS dev split in `data/csts_dev_reannotated.tsv`. 
The file is named `csts_dev_reannotated.tsv`. It is a tab-separated file with the following columns:
- `uid`: unique identifier for each data instance; the instances are in the same order as the original C-STS dev split
- `reannotated-label`: reannotated label for each instance
> Note: You need to refer to the [original C-STS repo](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/c-sts) to download the original sentence pairs, as we don't have the rights to distribute them.
